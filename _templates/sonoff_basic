You need to access the serial interface. The **four serial pins** (3V3, Rx, Tx, GND) are available in the middle of the PCB, right next to the on-board button. The square pin right next to the button is the 3.3V line. Hold the button while powering to enter flash mode. The LED remains off until the flashing process is done and the board is rebooted.
