Each hex has 19 LEDs, use `Pixels` command to set the right number of LEDs.

Microphone is mapped to Analog input but there is no support for sound reactive effects in Tasmota.

## Flashing

Use a flat screwdriver to separate the controller shell at the cable entry point. You will need to use force. After that separate the halves with a spudger or something similar that will not damage the plastic.
