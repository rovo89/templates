This plug was not flashable via tuya-convert, but it does come apart fairly easily.  

There is a single "triangle" screw between the hot and neutral male plug prongs, and then the edges of the plug pry open fairly easily;  there didn't seem to be any adhesive - just a friction fit.

The plug uses a TYWE3S (https://tasmota.github.io/docs/devices/TYWE3S/) chip, but the 3v3 is not easily accessible, so you need to solder onto a pad on the opposite side.
